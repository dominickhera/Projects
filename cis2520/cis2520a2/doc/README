type 'make' to run the makeFile

or

q1: gcc ./src/main.c ./src/avaliable.c -o ./bin/q1 -Iinclude

q2: gcc ./src/q2.c ./src/q2Stack.c -o ./bin/q2 -Iinclude

====================
known limitations
====================

q1

- only function 1 works and function 6 partially works only for printing out the available list 
- entering numbers into mileage will cause the program to break.

q2
- running q2 without the command line arguements will cause it to not work.


=======
testing
=======

q1
- ran into many errors with q1, could only manage to get function 1 working
- don't start a project with 4 days before it is due, and at 8 AM, you will burn. i have learned.

q2
- push was originally pushing to a struct made in the function and then the function was deleted
fixed by recreating the push function so now it properly pushes to the pre created stack.
