description
=============

- at the time of being posted, i once again neglected to understand just how difficult this project would actually be. It's currently partially functional in that it is able to parse the file into a 2d array, but then once i attempt to parse it into structs is where i fail.

====================
known limitations
====================

- program is only partially complete
- program parses text file into 2d array and then only gets initial data from text file
