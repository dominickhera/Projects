======
to run

./bin/tracker ./assets/test.csv

==========
to compile
==========
type 'make' to run the makeFile

====================
known limitations
====================
- numbers round up automatically for some reason.

=======
testing
=======
- name and group name were not printing initially and then i realised that i needed to change my createRecord function in linkedList.c to actually use the name and foodGroup instead of just mallocing room for it
- there was an issue where if the last food in the .csv was "j" then it would only print out the last line so then I realised that i was calling print list with the array instead of the head
