to run
=====
./bin/rogue ./assets/building.txt


to compile
=========
type 'make' to run the makeFile


program limitations
====================
- program doesnt full do all specifications
	- program will parse the lines of the building.txt, all but the very last number of the last item will work, it for some reasons changes to 0
	- program will only create rooms and allow hero to move in the first room, that's it
	- no items are spawned, no doors are created ( the efforts to try to create them are seen in the code)
- program seg faults on raspberrypi, only works on OS X so far (great finding that out in the last 30 minutes)
