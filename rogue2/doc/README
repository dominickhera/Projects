to run
=====
./bin/rogue ./assets/hard.txt


to compile
=========
type 'make' to run the makeFile


program limitations
====================
- hallway offsets are messed up and some print far off the screen
- combat seems to only work on enemies within the first room but fails to work in any other room
- when transitioning from room to hallway, it turns the doorway into a # character
- when picking up an item, the area of the item becomes a # character
- hallways designed for the lower rooms runs directly over top level rooms
- bats will move around randomly but will spawn again after dying

testing
=======
- bat enemy was spawning with 50 health, turns out it was a typing error in the code
