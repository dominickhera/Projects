known limitations
====================

- does not display the height and size of the avl search tree as requested for option 5
- only partially finds higher frequencies in option 6
- only partially deletes nodes in option 4


=======
testing
=======

- had left and right branches flipped while inserting which caused issues in other functions
- parsing was parsing the new line symbol as it's own key which was causing a mismatch of information
- fixing the previous issue lead to the program seg faulting when it came upon a blank line, was fixed quickly with a small if then statement that skips over the key if it's NULL
